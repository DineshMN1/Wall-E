# Wall-E: Autonomous Fleet-Based Rover System for Smart Agricultural Supervision

## Project Overview

**Wall-E** is a smart simulation and monitoring system that manages a **fleet of autonomous agricultural rovers** using **Webots Simulation** and a custom backend with real-time dashboards. It continuously fetches rover data every **2 seconds** and displays metrics like GPS location, battery, soil moisture, and temperature.

Each **rover** is assigned a dynamic session ID to sync individual data streams. This setup is ideal for precision agriculture, research, and scalable field automation projects.
